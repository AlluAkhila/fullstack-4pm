Differences Between var , let and const
Var:
var is a function scoped( where ever u declare in a function,it can be used through out function)
var can redeclare values
var can reassaign values
var can perform Hoisting(accessing values before initlaization, default value will be undefined)
Let:
let is a block scoped variable(where ever u declare, works only in that block(between the braces))
let cannot redeclare but can reassaign
let cannot allow u to access values before initlaization but values will be taken and stored in temporal Dead Zone(Script object)
Const:
const is also a block scoped variable(where ever u declare, works only in that block(between the braces))
const cannot redeclare and cannot reassaign
const cannot allow u to access values before initlaization but values will be taken and stored in temporal Dead Zone(Script object)


To debug you code use breakpoints or debugger keyword(it works only if developer tools onened)


Control Statements:
control statements are used to check the condition and maintain the flow of application based on condition

//simple If
